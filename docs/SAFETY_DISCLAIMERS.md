# Unmapped OS Safety Disclaimers

**IMPORTANT: READ BEFORE USE**

---

## General Disclaimer

Unmapped OS is a field intelligence tool designed to assist urban exploration. It is **NOT** a replacement for:

- Common sense and situational awareness
- Local emergency services
- Official travel advisories
- Professional security advice

---

## Location & Navigation

### GPS Accuracy

- GPS accuracy varies by device, environment, and signal conditions
- Urban canyons, tunnels, and indoor locations may have degraded accuracy
- Always verify your location visually before relying on coordinates
- The "Snapshot GPS" feature provides point-in-time location, not continuous tracking

### Map Data

- Map data is sourced from OpenStreetMap and may not reflect real-time conditions
- Roads, paths, and POIs may have changed since last data update
- Zone boundaries are approximate and for reference only
- Never assume a path is safe or passable based solely on map data

### Anchor Navigation

- Anchors are algorithmically selected and may not be optimal for all situations
- Verify anchor locations exist before navigating
- Some anchors may have moved, closed, or changed since pack generation
- Use anchors as reference points, not absolute destinations

## Safety Features

### Crisis Mode

Crisis Mode is designed to help in uncomfortable situations. It **CANNOT**:

- Contact emergency services automatically
- Guarantee your safety
- Replace calling local emergency numbers
- Work without battery or network (for safe phrase display)

**Always know local emergency numbers before traveling.**

### Safe Phrases

- Safe phrases are general de-escalation suggestions
- They may not be appropriate for all situations
- Cultural context varies; what works in one situation may not work in another
- Never rely solely on a phrase to exit a dangerous situation

### Safe Return Path

- Routes are calculated based on available data and may not reflect current conditions
- "Safe" corridors are estimates, not guarantees
- Always assess your surroundings when following any route
- Vitality estimates are approximations and vary by individual

## Crowdsourced Data

### User Reports

- Reports are submitted by users and may be:
  - Outdated
  - Inaccurate
  - Biased
  - Malicious (though we filter)
- Verify critical information from multiple sources
- Trust scores are indicators, not guarantees of accuracy

### Pricing Data

- Prices are user-submitted and may vary
- Price deltas (BARGAIN, OVERPRICED) are relative to recent submissions
- Actual prices may differ from reported medians
- Currency conversions are approximate

### Zone Status

- Zone status (ACTIVE, OFFLINE) reflects report aggregation
- An ACTIVE zone does not mean it is safe
- An OFFLINE zone may have resolved its issues
- Use zone status as one input among many in decision-making

## Privacy

### Data Collection

- We collect minimal data necessary for app function
- Shadow Mode provides additional privacy but limits features
- Location data is snapshot-only unless you enable specific features
- Review our Privacy Policy for complete data handling information

### Local Data
