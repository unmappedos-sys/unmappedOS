# Trust & Accuracy Disclaimer

> **Unmapped OS provides travel intelligence, not guarantees.**

## What This App Is

Unmapped OS is a crowd-sourced travel intelligence platform designed to help independent travelers make informed decisions. It aggregates:

- OpenStreetMap structural data
- User-submitted observations
- Weather conditions
- Historical patterns

## What This App Is NOT

- ❌ A real-time navigation system
- ❌ A safety guarantee
- ❌ An official source of truth
- ❌ A replacement for local knowledge
- ❌ An endorsement of any location

## Core Principles

### 1. No Perfect Information Exists

Travel conditions change constantly. What was true yesterday may not be true today:
- Prices fluctuate
- Vendors relocate
- Areas gentrify or decline
- Events create temporary changes
- Construction appears overnight

**Our response**: We show confidence scores, not certainties.

### 2. Trust Is Earned, Not Assumed

New data enters the system at reduced trust:
- Fresh intel must be verified by others
- Conflicting reports reduce zone confidence
- Time erodes confidence (data decays)
- Multiple hazard reports trigger zone offline status

**Our response**: Transparent confidence scoring with clear explanations.

### 3. Degraded Data Is Better Than No Data

When confidence is low, we:
- Show clear warnings
- Reduce the prominence of uncertain zones
- Still provide the data (with caveats)
- Let users make informed choices

**Our response**: Graceful degradation, never false confidence.

### 4. User Safety Comes First

The kill switch exists because:
- Multiple hazard reports = real concern
- It's better to hide a zone than risk harm
- Recovery requires fresh verification
- We err on the side of caution

**Our response**: Automatic protection mechanisms.

## Confidence Level Meanings

### 🟢 HIGH (80-100%)
**Interpretation**: Recent, verified, multiple confirmations.

**What this means**: 
- Someone trustworthy was here recently
- Multiple reports agree
- No conflicts or concerns
- This data is probably accurate

**Caveat**: "Probably" is not "definitely." Always use common sense.

### 🟡 MEDIUM (60-79%)
**Interpretation**: Some recent intel, generally reliable.

**What this means**:
- Data is reasonably current
- No major red flags
- Could benefit from fresh verification

**Caveat**: Good enough for exploration, but don't bet your trip on it.

### 🟠 LOW (40-59%)
**Interpretation**: Limited recent data, use with caution.

**What this means**:
- Data is getting old
- Few recent reports
- Situation may have changed

**Caveat**: Treat as rough guidance only. Verify locally.

### 🔴 DEGRADED (20-39%)
**Interpretation**: Very old or conflicting data.

**What this means**:
- We have almost no recent intel
- Reports may conflict
- This zone needs fresh eyes

**Caveat**: Consider this data unreliable. Use only as a starting point.

### ⛔ OFFLINE
**Interpretation**: Zone disabled due to safety concerns.

**What this means**:
- Multiple hazard reports received
- Zone automatically protected
- Will recover after review period

**Caveat**: Avoid this zone until status clears.

---

## Price Data Disclaimer

Price submissions reflect:
- What **one person** paid
- At **one specific time**
- At **one specific place** within a zone
- With **their specific negotiation skills**

Prices vary based on:
- Tourist appearance
- Negotiation
- Time of day
- Vendor mood
- Events/holidays
- Currency fluctuations

**Never assume prices are fixed. Always verify locally.**

---

## Safety Disclaimer

Unmapped OS provides observations, not safety guarantees.

### We Cannot Know:
- Current crime conditions
- Political situations
- Health risks
- Natural disaster threats
- Personal safety factors specific to you

### Always:
- Check official travel advisories
- Register with your embassy
- Have emergency contacts
- Trust your instincts on the ground
- Have backup plans

### The Kill Switch Is Not Perfect
Multiple hazard reports trigger offline status, but:
- One critical incident can happen before reports
- Bad actors could spam false reports
- Real dangers might go unreported

**Your safety is ultimately your responsibility.**

## Intel Submission Ethics

When you submit intel, you're affecting other travelers' decisions. Please:

### DO:
✅ Report what you actually experienced  
✅ Be specific and recent  
✅ Update old reports if things changed  
✅ Report genuine safety concerns immediately  
✅ Include context (time, date, circumstances)  

### DON'T:
❌ Report hearsay or rumors  
❌ Exaggerate or fabricate  
❌ Submit vindictive reports  
❌ Spam the system  
❌ Report on places you haven't visited  

### Consequences
- False reports hurt other travelers
- Patterns of abuse result in account restrictions
- Serious abuse may result in permanent bans

## The Bottom Line

**Unmapped OS is a tool, not a guide.** 

It shows you what other travelers have observed, weighted by confidence in that data. It never claims perfect knowledge, and neither should you assume it.

Use this app to:
- Discover areas you might explore
- Get rough pricing guidance
- Understand zone "textures"
- Contribute your observations

Don't use this app to:
- Make safety-critical decisions alone
- Assume any data is current
- Navigate blindly
- Replace local knowledge

**Travel smart. Verify locally. Trust your instincts.**
